## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6 or higher**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Pygame Library**: This project relies on Pygame for rendering and event handling.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pygame-window-manager.git
   cd pygame-window-manager
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install Pygame directly:*

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

Run the application using Python:

```bash
python window_manager.py
